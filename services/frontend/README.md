Here's a simple yet effective README for your frontend service:

---

# Frontend Service

This project is the frontend for the microservices-based application, built with **React** and bundled using **Vite**. It communicates with the backend services via REST APIs to display the data.

## Features

- Built with **React** and **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds.
- Utilizes **Docker** for containerization, allowing the app to run seamlessly in any environment.
- Connects with the **User Service** and **Product Service** via REST API endpoints.
- Designed for scalability and easy integration with other microservices.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DestinyObs/microservices-project.git
cd microservices-project/services/frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Running with Docker

You can also run the frontend service using Docker for a seamless containerized experience. 

#### Build and start the frontend container:

```bash
docker-compose up --build frontend
```

This will automatically build the container and run the frontend service. The service will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Accessing the Service

The frontend communicates with the backend services through the following URLs:

- **User Service**: `http://user-service:5001`
- **Product Service**: `http://product-service:5002`

These services are part of the Docker network, and the frontend makes requests to them using their respective container names.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

If needed, you can configure the backend API URLs in the `src/config.js` file:

```js
export const BACKEND_USER_URL = "http://user-service:5001"; 
export const BACKEND_PRODUCT_URL = "http://product-service:5002";
```

This file contains the backend URLs that the frontend uses to interact with the respective microservices.

## Dockerfile

The Dockerfile builds the React application and serves it via a development server. It is optimized for local development with Docker.

```Dockerfile
# Use Node.js as the base image
FROM node:16-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy all app files
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000 and start the React development server
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with Docker and file watching, ensure you have polling enabled for file changes in Docker using the `--host 0.0.0.0` flag.
  
- If the frontend isn't loading correctly, check if the backend services (user-service, product-service) are running and accessible.
